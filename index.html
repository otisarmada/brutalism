        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>We don't expect art, films or literature to be so pretty so why is it we expect our meals to be? In the pursuit of happiness, pleasantness and approval amongst our peers have we ironed out the grit in the world; And what for we wonder? sweet natured niceness? long lived loveliness? pleasant nothings which seek to soothe?
            <br>
            This event will channel Brutalism’s triumphant indifference to commonality. A deliberate flouting of conventional ideas of beauty. Brutalism has always sparked vehement debate about the necessity and/or irrelevance of aesthetics. A debate which Otis Armada is determined to bring back to the surface. 
            <br>
            For our next event we refocus our attention to the elements of food, art, wine and music which evade superficiality. Elements that happily triumph in discordance with the norm, those bestial successes that parade proudly as concrete monstrosities of culture. Carefully curated sittings will deliver a raw barrage of unmatchably bountiful offerings over an unfolding feast.</p>

        <h2>What to expect</h2>
        <p>The Otis Armada team prides ourselves on approaching a feast in no style but our own. We want our experience to be as gratifying to the eyes and ears as it is to the palate. Over the course of a few hours a parade of curated food, wine and art will be served. Otis Armada salutes communal eating so it is likely you will meet some other deviants you ought to revel with. We will all be sitting together and served at once. Before and in-between your five courses will be a host of small snacks which will make you think and encourage you to drink. Beer, Wine and some ruff stuff will be paired with each plate. You won’t leave hungry, you won’t leave empty handed and we advise you don’t drive.
        <br>
        In some cases specific allergies can be accommodated. Unfortunately we are unable to provide vegetarian alternatives.</p>
        <h2>Creative Team</h2>
        <p>Laura Clauscen, Lauren Stephens & Fred Mora Practise Studio Practise, Lucky Prawn, Sugar Prawn Across the whole Otis Creative team is a mixed shopping bag of projects spanning from installation design to bespoke media content.

        <h2>Founder & Producer</h2>
        <p>Gus Carmichael
        <br>
        Gus has dipped in and out of hospitality in a most aerobatic way. From playing and curating music at wine events like Highway One Street Party to selling bottles at Milton Wine shop he has a wide casting net of knowledge and expertise which come into play when we deliver the service we expect from OA.</p>
        <h2>Executive Chief</h2>
        <p>Ali Currey Voumard
        <br>
        Ex Cumulus Inc, Moon Under Water
        <br>
        Ali has been with Otis since the start. Undoubtedly she is a big part of the creative team but the only one trusted to use a sharp knife and fire, so we call her Chef. At 16, Ali moved to Melbourne from Tasmania to pursue cooking in some of Melbourne’s most renowned kitchens including Cumulus Inc and Moon Under Water. While subscribing to no singular style, Ali’s fascination with raw produce and fermentation always finds it’s way into her creations.  Ali is piecing together a crack team of young chefs free of restraint and full of dedication to the cause.</p>
